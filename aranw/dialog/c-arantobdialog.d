A few campaigns with mercenary companies, a few battles, and lots of wandering about has brought him to Amn.

OK, then came the little matter of ToB Joining dialog, and how to set things for Romance. For male PCs, this really doesn't matter. Aran can pick up and run with it. But for female PCs, the same problem Berelinde had with going between BG1 and BG2 with Gavin gets into play here. We have three "Fate Spirit" summons for female PC's, allowing declaration of "friend", "lover", and "former lover", setting the romance variable to 0, 2, or 3. But with the in-depth content in play in BG2, it makes it difficult to follow further whether they have had an on-again off-again relationship, or what they have done together.

There is another consideration - testing. Basically, after each opportunity to flirt or lovetalk or whatever, I want an easy way of determining the status of the relationship without always having to type in the CLUAConsole (because I sink at typing). And a very common player post is about how to set or change the romance variables, or check on them. So, an opportunity that is more in-depth than the standard PID "breakup, flirt, no flirt" options... something that during joining, rejoining, and regular play the player can use to check on (and perhaps change) the status. If playtesters dislike it, we can always drop it - it does mean that a player can "change history" on the fly the way it is currently coded. That might be useful for testing, but might not be so cool in play.

Copies go in pre-joined ToB, Joined ToB, Post-Joined ToB, Post-Joined SoA, and Joined SoA. Initiating links could loop in anywhere, but this probably is best set up as a PID option "status check".
Still to integrate:
c-aranfirstsex = 1 : self-identified no experience (no need to look for whether or not RE content, etc. is in play -  leaves the option for play as a manipulative PC "Oh, I have never done this before" is something that could be said many many ways)

idea presented by Autumn Bard - mirrors some of the close tracking of progress in Berelinde's Gavin and Jastey's Ajantis.

c-aransex = 0 : no intimacy
c-aransex = 1 : kissing
c-aransex = 2 : touching + kissing
c-aransex = 3 : heavy innuendo touching ("petting")
c-aransex = 4 : full physical intimacy

So, a dialog for checking
