== BHAERDA ~[HAERDALIS] Ah, but the simplest are often the best. Come, tell me a tale. Entertain this poor sparrow, before he begins tearing at the nest in boredom and ennui!~
== C-ARANB ~[ARAN] Well, I did hear tell of a bard who got bored one day. So he turns to his friend, and says, 'Fred, tell us a story.'~

== C-ARANB ~[ARAN] Yes, my friend?~
== BHAERDA ~[HAERDALIS] I do believe that I understand the story. Perhaps we should explore song, instead, my eagle.~
== C-ARANB ~[ARAN] Sure thing! Many's the time th' trail has been lightened by simple song. How about 'Ninety-nine bottles o' Ale on th' Wall, Ninety-nine bottles o' Ale, Take one down an' pass it around; Ninety-eight bottles o' Ale on the Wall. Ninety-eight bottles o' Ale on the Wall, Ninety-eight bottles o' Ale, Take one down...~

== C-ARANB ~[ARAN] I can read this stuff here, but I can't remember it. I keep trying, but I just can't get it memorized. You seem to remember everything, an' your lifespan's a mite longer than mine. How do you do it?~
== BHAERDA ~[HAERDALIS] Mnemonics. The occult study of memorization by association. For instance, I think of Artless Aran. That brings a mental picture of you, and assists my recall of all sorts of interesting things. Here, by fledgling, try it yourself. Look at a person, and think of a description mirroring the name. It will serve you well.~
== C-ARANB ~[ARAN] OK, let me give it a shot. How about 'Happy Haer'Dalis'?~
== BHAERDA ~[HAERDALIS] While this poor sparrow is not always happy, I think you have the idea, Aran. A huge generalization that acts as an index to memory. But keep your voice low, my friend. Not everyone is amused by playing such games with their names.~

== C-ARANB IF ~InParty("Valygar")~ THEN ~[ARAN] Vehement Valygar. All business an' no real pleasure. Someone's got to get that man a pint an' a good tumble wi' a fine wench, and soon. Too tightly wound, that one.~
== C-ARANB IF ~InParty("Anomen")~ THEN ~[ARAN] Arseholic Anomen. Stuck up prig.~

== C-ARANB IF ~InParty("BWTOUCHX")~ THEN ~[ARAN] Twiggy Touchstone. That reminds me. I need to get th' boy a bath, an' right quick. There's bein' part o' nature, sure, but once in awhile it might be a good idea to wash some o' it off.~
== C-ARANB IF ~InParty("CALLISTO")~ THEN ~[ARAN] Crazed Callisto. You don't rightly want to be around when she gets enraged, eh? There's no tellin' where her weapons get pointed.~

== C-ARANB IF ~InParty("FHLAND")~ THEN ~[ARAN] Artless Andrei. It don't rightly fit completely, on account o' him bein' a smart lad, just a raw recruit. A bit sheltered. But close enough.~
== C-ARANB IF ~InParty("FHLSEB")~ THEN ~[ARAN] Slippery Sebastian. I 'm not rightly sure I have gotten a straight answer out o' that one. Nine times out o' ten, I think he knows more than he lets on, eh?~

== C-ARANB IF ~InParty("IYLOS")~ THEN ~[ARAN] Insolent Iylos. I suppose that be his job. But th' backtalk, well, he could be a mite more respectful. <CHARNAME>'s been a force for a long time, an' here comes th' big bad investigator.~
== C-ARANB IF ~InParty("J#Kelsey")~ THEN ~[ARAN] Kindred Kelsey. He knows merchant, he knows some fightin' ways - an' I do think he's a right fine party member.~

Xysterous, like them healer's tools? No. Ok, how about wigglin' th' rules, an' goin' wi' Zealous Xan? He talks all doom an' gloom, but he doesn't back off from no fights.~

/* Punching the 4th Wall Hard: The concept of 4th wall has come up before; in general, a little goes a long way. But there are some in-game fun stuff, from Sir Kalthorine's cool appearance in ToB back in the day, when he was a rabid fan so helpful and active on the boards that BioWare made reference to him in-game, all the way to the use of Garrick in a gentle rip-off of Cyrano De Bergerac (some of you know it as the Steve Martin movie "Roxanne" or any of a dozen other re-tellings, but us Intellectual Purist Snobs(tm) know it as Edmund Rostund's cool play about a dude with a long nose...). Basically, too much of Ferris Beuhler's turning to the audience and addressing them, or cans of Coke turning up on Star Trek, or any other odd breakage of the "willing suspension of disbelief" required for fun roleplaying, and the element of farce breaks up the game for the player. So, a fun little challenge - let's play with first lines from classics, which breaks 4th wall, but "FR-ize" them. Can we have some fun reinterpreting classics enough to make those heavy readers among us laugh, while allowing the participants to remain firmly entrenched behind their Wall of impenetrable Canonical Knowledge Of The Way Things Are In Faerun? Let's see... */

Happy, though, on account o' it put me in your path, eh?~
  = ~[ARAN] But a long time ago Gerris an' I were workin' across to th' Moonshae Isles on one o' them short-haul galleys what ply that route out o' Neverwinter.

He had to be right creative, on account o' most o' th' crew were Luskan fisher folk, an' thought a good meal were dried fish an' small beer. Well, one o' th' older oarsmen, he took a dislike to Gerris right off. There was naught Gerris could do to please th' bastard.

Gerris didn't say naught, just took the punch, then made some sort o' gesture. Th' two stalked off, an' everyone gave 'em both as wide a berth as possible. Well, two days later, th' oarsman came runnin' up from th' head... that be th' latrine, on a boat - a privy, right? Well, he came up just hollerin' bloody murder, ran past us, an' dove over th' side.

  = ~[ARAN] Now, I don't rightly think there were no magic in Gerris' hands, him followin' monks ways so short a time. So when I saw him back wi' his wife an' daughter when I got to Amn a few years later, I got him right drunk an' asked him how he did it. An' that's how I learned that a small amount o' fireberries be a great spice... but you put too many in a man's portion, you'd best be gettin' a new set o' clothes lined up right quick, an' some healin' salves on hand.~

/* SoA Story Pool :  Boy, I have been playing a little Mount & Blade, I think... */

  SAY ~[ARAN] Well, I had just come off o' th' Moonshae Isles, about as down as a lad can be. My ladylove dead, th' Moonshae companies disbandin' on account o' we thrashed th' Iron Throne bastards... well, more like you thrashed Sarevok an' wiped out their command structure, but th' fightin' in the field was still fierce for a bit afterward. Sometimes it takes awhile for an army to realize that th' war be over. Anyways, I was wanderin' around Nashkel, when th' Guildmaster calls me in an' gives me some work punchin' north on th' Trade way. Small caravan, just a full fist, not anythin' big. A tag along, really, as there were a load o' more powerful costers what had hired th' Flamin' Fist to protect some serious tradin' wagons headed up Neverwinter way, an' we were just really for show more than anythin'. But it was work, so I was not goin' to be turnin' it down, eh? We headed out mid-winter, tryin' our luck.~
  = ~[ARAN] Well, we made it up into th' hills north o' Nashkel, an' were just south o' Beregost when we ran into a snow squall in th' middle o' a clear day. Me an' Kalavi... she were th' Stave, th' cleric, right?  But she fought better than most, as she had just recently taken up wi' Ilmater and had been a seasoned fighter same as me... we knew there was more to this than just some freak weather, on account o' no snow squall we ever saw had lightnin' accompanyin' it.~
  = ~[ARAN] We spurred up ahead straight into th' storm, keepin' our eyes open, her wi' a big staff an' me wi' my trusty sword ready. Th' wind was somethin' fierce, an' we were about to turn back out when we broke clear into a bubble o' protection o' some sort. We found ourselves suddenly in th' open, at full gallop across a field o' icy cobblestones, runnin' right up th' arse o' two ice trolls an' a whole mess o' orcs.~
  = ~[ARAN] Lucky for us Tymora's Coin was spinnin' our direction. They was too busy payin' attention to th' 'Fist in field plate whackin' at 'em, an' th mage what was holdin' off that magical storm wi' some kind o' big bubble shield. Good thing, too, on account o' we couldn't have stopped short nohow, not at that speed an' wi' all that ice. Kalavi, she started sayin' somethin', some spell I suppose, but thought better o' it fast enough - tryin' to hold a spell while on horseback is way above what most seasoned clerics can do, an' she had no more than four or five spells total granted by her Cryin' God. Me, I don't fight cavalry-style, but beggars can't rightly be choosers, so I leaned forward an' swung wide, hopin' I wasn't about to kill my own mount leavin' me on th' wrong side o' th' shield wall, so to speak. Kalavi came in fast an' brought her staff up like some kind o' fancy lance, an' I'll be damned if it didn't do th' trick. She hit at full gallop, nailin' one o' th' ice trolls in th' head an' knockin' it unconscious  wi' one hit, an' then her mount leaped clean over th' shield wall, where she could join in on th' fun proper. Took out one o' th' strongest adversaries, did a nice trick, an' it were a pretty sight. Me, on th' other hand...~
  = ~[ARAN] ...well, I hadn't ever fought no ice Trolls before. So I lopped it's head off beautifully, nice clean arc, before I slipped too far forward an' ended up takin' a right fast rollin' tumble off my horse. So there I was, all th' wind knocked out o' me, actin' as a bowlin' ball in among the orcs. Well, I scared th' crap out o' some o' them, an' they took to their heels... so I thought I was all in th' clear. I rolled right up to my feet, dusted myself off, an' started walkin' forward to th' line. All those Fist an' Kalavi started whoopin' an' hollerin', and so I just sort o' took a bow, thinkin' they was cheerin' me for scatterin' th' whole mob. Just as I did, I feel a whiff o' ice cold air on th' back o' my neck, an' tripped forward flat on my face.~
  = ~[ARAN] Well, long story short, I didn't know that ice trolls just grow back if there be no fire nor acid scattered. My lucky little bow an' trip saved me my sorry hide, as there was now two Ice trolls clawin' at me. Th' Fist an' Kalavi clobbered 'em both pincushionin' them wi' arrows an' sling stones spelled wi' fire, savin' my sorry arse. But th' officer in charge o' th' Fist didn't realize it were my own clumsiness an' a twist o' Tymora's Coin what did the trick. She thought I clobbered th' troll, bowled over th' orcs, took a casual bow in front o' th' two trolls, an cool as a cucumber stopped dropped, an' rolled to allow th' rest o' th' unit to take 'em out. She hired us both on th' spot, an' we never told naught about it.~

  = ~[ARAN] Well, I was a mite green, an' I didn't look like much. They was mostly copper haired an' sharp faced, an' here I looked like a soft version o' th Northmen. So the hazin' began right quick. One o' th' sergeants, he got a little bothered that I were pokin' my nose in around a fair lass, so when it be time for th' first skirmish, I got assigned to scout. He sent me in, declarin' I was no better than a piece o' straw, an' if I had any guts at all I'd go take a piss in th' Northmen's camp.~

  = ~[ARAN] My first time, I didn't know too much more than a recruit, especially as I had never trained wi' no axe, let alone a battleaxe. So I looked a right fool in front o' them. That were a mite bit o' a problem, as they didn't want no outsider endangerin' 'em. Plus, th' sergeant had his eyes on a right fine lass, who were lookin' eyes at me.

They looked up at me, I looked down at them, an' one o' them said somethin' in th' way o' a question. Me, I didn't wait...

I couldn't even hold up one o' their axes, an' to make it worse, the sergeant's lass was makin' eyes at me an' smilin' somethin' fierce, which were like to tick him off right proper. They was all red-haired sharp-nosed berserkers, an' here I was just a lick-spittle from th' 'Coast, puttin' on like I were somethin'.

I grabbed me a set o' furs, an' covered up a mite, an' grunted at a few sentries as I passed, an' soon enough I were at th' Chief's campfire.

  = ~[ARAN] My Dearest Elena,

I read your message with great happiness. Congratulations on your being advanced to choice! By the time you read this there will only be a few more months and you will be in your final year of apprenticeship. And Mystra is a good Goddess to serve, I hear. I always thought you would lean toward The Wise One, Oghma, and go with the Estelmer family nobility as benefactors, but you know your own heart. If your calling is to Mystra, then I guess you couldn't do any better than to Eltorchul family. There are some stories about a few of them, but they generally get written about as good people, for nobles and wands. Good but not lockstep; some of them are pretty wild, if trail stories and news broadsides talk about the same family. The Thunderstaffs follow Mystra, but from my end - plenty of warmages from that family, that is for sure! I was pretty sure you wouldn't end up following them, anyways. I am really glad your benefactor was happy, too. I thought it was like a trade apprenticeship, and you would be with The Lady Mage all the way. I guess I didn't understand about the schools, and how you work your way up.
I love the emerald, and I will figure out what you mean about saying the inscriptions in private once we are on the trail. I hope this isn't one of your practical jokes, though. That is too fine a gem just to put a joke on. And the colors were beautiful. It lasted a full thirty seconds before dissolving into smoke, and it was a deep, shiny green with gold and silver and sky blue. Plus, it only erased a little bit of the parchment, so I got to read most of the message. That is so much better than the one where you tried the acid-flowers, and it burned through the whole letter. I know you want to have each message destroy itself, though I do not understand why all mages seem to need such secrecy.
I do have some news. I have started working with a new group. There is not much to say yet, but it is not a regular mercenary group. <CHARNAME>, the one who leads, is different. I will have more to say later, I am sure. In the meantime, keep up your studies, and I will try to send you some of the spell components you asked about as best I can. Judging by the look of things, I may be able to get some very rare components for you just by keeping my eyes open and wits sharp.
  Yours Faithfully, Aran~

I am writing from the trail, so please excuse the occasional blot or crease staining the writing. There is so much to report, but most of it is not to be trusted to letters. When I next see you, remind me to tell you about <PLAYER1>. Things are working out well enough on so far. Well as well as can be expected given our challenges. I have not had as much combat in so short a timeframe since the pitched battles back near Baldur's Gate. Even in the Axes, there were months with no combat, and now it seems to happen every day.
I am glad to hear that your roommate is not making your life easy. I know that sounds unsupportive, and I am sure you don't appreciate it, but from my standpoint it means you are telling me things and not hiding the challenges and problems. You are smart enough to get past this. Just don't do what you did to Kimili when she called you those names. I bet now that you have some real training, it would not be a few curls set on fire... you might accidentally incinerate her head.
I did hear from Nathan the other day, and his letter asked after you. I told him you were away in the Dale lands, rather than the truth. I know you think that he is cute, but I know him. He is not a nice person. I may sound overprotective, but he has done some things you just do not want to know about.
Well, I must close, as I am out of room, and low on supplies. Time to mix up some more ink, too. As always.

I hope that all is well with you. For me, I am sorely in need of your guidance. I know we have written about this several times, but I need to clear my head and think and you are always good at helping me do that. I cannot stop thinking about her. I cannot stop watching her. It has me off balance, even worse than when I fell for that half-elven bard you warned me against. I simply do not understand how I could be pulled so far under her spell in such a short time. I know I am not an apprentice, but I certainly feel like one. I know I wrote to you of my feelings, and I know we joked about the difficulties of falling for one's employer, but now I am serious.
I do not know if you would like her, or not. But do not believe the stories that must be floating around about what we are doing. All I can say is that she has captivated my attention in a way no other woman has. Yes, even more than SilverEyes. I just have difficulties seeing what I can offer her in return. I have no wealth or title, no real prospects, and I do not even know if she truly would have me. But that is how serious my situation seems to have become. For Sune's Blessing and for the love of your brother, help me. I need to know what a woman of power really wants.

I hope that all is well with you, and with your pet lizard (yes, I know he is a pseudodragon, but someone has to put her in her place!). I am happy your work in runescribing is coming along, but please remember about spell duration. Half of your last message burned through your last three letters to me, and nearly turned my pack into a bonfire. I know you prefer secrecy, but surely I can keep one or two of your missives?
There are many things going on right now, and I am not at liberty to write much about them. Our goals are being met, though the victories seem very costly. Perhaps it is more that I have made a stronger commitment to this quest than I have before. Your advice was appreciated. I am happy you see me that way, but I am pretty sure that you did not really mean "just kiss her and keep kissing her until she either kills you or professes her love". I understand what you are saying about power being of many kinds, and that sometimes just being yourself is what she might need. I do not know the best way to proceed right now, but I will take your advice under advisement and continue as best I can.
In the meantime, I will be enclosing a small packet of wildspeare flowers for your component pouch when I get a chance to send this. I hope that it helps your studies. Please try not to turn Jill into a flowerpot again. I know that the polymorph spell usually results in squirrels, berrygobblers, or chipmunks rather than inanimate objects, so study hard and next time it might go better.

  = ~[ARAN] My Dearest Elena,

  Congratulations on winning your competition! I had no idea that things were so competitive at the academy, and I am very glad that the Priests of Ilmater were there when that boy got caught in the fireball. I am so happy you won, and you even gave me ideas for a new set of tactics to use. I doubt I will often be able to spread oil or grease before a battle, but the use of multiple layers of magic is not something I have studied very much. The way things are going around here, we may need all the tactical advantages I can come up with.
  As for your inquiries, she is holding her own against the power of her blood. I do not have any real answers for you as to whether she sees me as someone who she could be with forever, or just someone she can use temporarily. I hear her words, and I see her responses, but I often am not quite sure where she really is coming from. She may be shouting her truth at me all the time, for all I know, but I am simply not sure if I am hearing reality or something I have constructed all in my head. You know as well as I do that I have done that before, and the results have been less than positive.
  There will be time enough to write more later. I will be enclosing a few odds and ends gleaned from our last few combats, but I am unsure as to how to stop them from breaking when transported to you. If the letter you are holding is a bright black on one corner, then I would seek out the Priests for healing immediately. I am never sure why you want me to send you these things, as my training has been in writing, not herbalism, but you know that I would do anything for you.
  Yours faithfully, Aran~

  = ~[ARAN] My Dearest Elena,

I hope my letter finds you in good health and spirits. I will get straight to the point and remind you that you are too special and to smart to fall into any traps. Be careful. I do not know anything about Court and have never really seen a Masked Lord or even an un-masked one, but I have been around long enough to be suspicious of anyone who makes bold passes at you. I wish I were there, so that he would know that you have a protector. I know you can take care of yourself, but it still worries me. If you need proof, remember how I have acted around Giselle and Rani, and how you had to send a spark at me to stop me from behaving badly with your friends.
Yes, I know I have a double standard, but I have always been very interested in all of this romantic sparking, while you have avoided it like the plague. And our situations are not as similar as you made it sound. <CHARNAME> is more complicated than what we are talking about. If it were just for fun, that would be one thing, but I seem to have developed some attachments that make things more painful for me if I do things that she might not like. I always try to fit what she seems to want, but it is hard sometimes. In fact, it seems almost impossible at times. But I trust in Tymora, and She will make the coin toss. What is meant to be, is meant to be. In your case, though, your benefactor might not take kindly to that particular young man. Do not take this the wrong way, but you have to ask yourself if he is really interested in you, or if he wants information.
I trust you to make the right choice for you, of course. I would send for you to join us for a little bit, so you could get away and think, but I am afraid things here have gotten very difficult. Our adversaries are the stiff of legends and folktales, only they turn out to be real. Usually, they also turn out to be able to crush me into goo. No matter what is going on there, things are worse here. Do not worry for me, though. I have always had an eye out for trouble, and I think I enjoy feeling part of something that will make a difference.

IF ~~ a880 SAY ~[ARAN] Though if you are lookin' for a partner to try a few practice runs, Anishai, You could always try to get a good feel o' what's in my pocket... by Mask's Mighty Mouth, you could charm th' trousers off o' me, you could.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a881 SAY ~[ARAN] Besides, Azure, I know better than to be makin' time wi' you. Sharo's a pretty sensitive wolf, an' might not take kindly to us takin' too long, private -like.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a882 SAY ~[ARAN] BLOODY HELLS, OUCH! By Lathander's Sunny Sh... Gavin, what in th' hells do you think I'm usin' to walk with, my hands? Look, I know I don't rightly use th' tops o' my feet for much, but that's no reason for you to use 'em as steppin' stones.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a883 SAY ~[ARAN] I'm goin' to kick myself for sayin' that, too, Haldamir, on account o' you don't talk much to anyone, an' here you go tryin' to start a conversation. Talk about bad timin'.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a884 SAY ~[ARAN] An' you can stop lookin' at me w' those cold stone grey eyes, y' old shortaxe. I like Lathander well enough, an' you don't need to go convertin' me to your ways.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a885 SAY ~[ARAN] Though how you got into this adventurin' party, Britt, is a mystery to me, you know. I thought you were just pullin' my leg about joinin' on. I suspect there's been some divine intervention what's made you take up adventurin'.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a886 SAY ~[ARAN] An' lay off th' advice, Touchstone, m'boyo. You Wild Elves have been around a mite longer than me an' my kinfolk, I know, but here's more to th' world than trees, bugs, an' grass. Well, at least there's also mud, soot, an' grime, based on what you be wearin' right now.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a887 SAY ~[ARAN] An' stay ahead o' me, Callisto. Mask's Blade, you are a right fine fighter, but you worry me, you do. You get all out o' control, an' there's nothin' what can stop you. I wouldn't want to have no 'accident' or nothin'.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a888 SAY ~[ARAN] besides, if it s that coin I owe you, Bruce m'boy, I'm tapped out until <CHARNAME> loosens those purse strings. So don't go all 'beat your arse' this an' 'youse gonna get yours' on me, eh? Just get <CHARNAME> to drop a few coin my way, an' I'll get square wi' you.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a889 SAY ~[ARAN] I don't want to drive you away, none, Branwen you are a fine figure o' a woman. All that 'Tempus' Shield' talk, though, it worries me a mite. I'd offer you some companionship, but I'd rather not be askin' you to heal th' parts o' my body you might cut off.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a890 SAY ~[ARAN] Aye, I did check up on th' idea, Jonathan, an' you'd be a fine addition to any one o' three different Guilds. I can write up th' letters for you, if you want, but the again, what be th' hurry? Th' Guilds take a tithe, an' you are doin' right fine as an independent, watchin' <CHARNAME>'s back.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END

IF ~~ a893 SAY ~[ARAN] Not that I don't appreciate some bubbly happiness an' sunshine in my day, m'darlin' Alora, but I need to concentrate right now. An' that 'happy happy joy joy' spirit o' yours might break it. Plus, last time you got all huggy wi' me, half my purse mysteriously went missin'... don't you play "Happy Hin" wi' me, lassie! I can't rightly afford it right now!~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a894 SAY ~[ARAN] I don't have much time for no bloodsucker, nohow, Miriam. Especially when I don't rightly know which 'we' is you. I don't know why <CHARNAME> don't just throw a stake through your heart an' be done wi' you.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a895 SAY ~[ARAN] I'll tell you what, though, Nikitalleria. When we next camp, I will trade you fair an' square.

This is just friend to friend, see?~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a896 SAY ~[ARAN] Besides, m'lady Ninafer, shouldn't you be chattin' up Anomen or somethin'? I think you are a right fine woman, an' all. But the boy's the jealous type, an' an officer an' all. I got enough o' him ridin' my back without you makin' it worse.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a897 SAY ~[ARAN] An' stand where I can see you, Coran. Th' ladies might like your 'charmin' rogue' act, but me, I'm not that impressed.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END

IF ~~ a899 SAY ~[ARAN] You can charm the breath out o' me an th' trousers off o' me, Alassa, with just the bat o' an eyelash. An' worse, you know it. But keep those gorgeous eyes an' pert lips out o' my business. You would skin me an' serve me raw if it got you an extra few coin, laughin' all the way to Calimport.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a900 SAY ~[ARAN] By Tempus' Shield, Branwen, you are a sight for sore eyes. But I don't have no time to talk about following Tempus right now. Come talk to me when we are campin', or some such time.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a901 SAY ~[ARAN] M'lady Wychlaran, I don't mean no disrespect. An' please don't turn me into no toad, nor squirrel, nor naught like that, Dynaheir. I just don't have no words t' speak right now.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a902 SAY ~[ARAN] I'm no prude, Fade, an' I respect th' Guild rightly enough. An accomplished Knife's a right good part o' a party, an' you keep th' Shadow Thieves appeased. But I don't trust no tiefling, no way, no how. So unless it's business, keep to yourself, girl.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a903 SAY ~[ARAN] Come by an' chat later, though, Andrei. We can spar a bit, an' swap stories. Or, I can tell stories an' you can listen.

Now, that were a fight for a bard to describe...~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a904 SAY ~[ARAN] Though you could do me a right good favor, Sebastian, an' lay off Andrei. The lad's a decent enough sort, an' he needs some breathin' room you don't give him. I'll watch his back, don't you worry.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a905 SAY ~[ARAN] I don't have nothin' to say to you nohow, Irenicus. I spoke my piece back when we kicked your sorry arse. I'd tell you to get lost in any o' th' hells, but you've already done that.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a906 SAY ~[ARAN] But come have a drink wi' me when you can, Ghareth. I want to hear more about th' Cowled an' their ways. Forewarned is forearmed, an' all that time enforcin' for 'em has got some good stories, I bet. I'll trade you, an' tell you about th' time I was servin wi' Moonshae an' we had a bit o' warlock trouble. Talk abut uncontrolled magic...~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a907 SAY ~[ARAN] I know that look, Cassius love, an' you are about to charm me wi' those stories o' heroism an' such. Th' trouble wi' all you Skalds an' your tales is that when th' hero slays th' monster an' looks about, there's not much left o' th' rest o' th' party. Write one o' them tale where the kitchen maid an' her four friends beat th' crap out o' a dragon an' all live to tell the tale, an' I'll listen!~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a908 SAY ~[ARAN] Better yet, keep yer distance, you floatin' eyeball. I can't rightly make out your accent anyways. An' people think *my* accent be hard to follow...~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a909 SAY ~[ARAN] Now, hold on to your jawbone, an' stop scratchin' th' inside o' that left eyesocket, Horace. I got enough trouble stayin' un-spooked just lookin' at you, let alone talkin' to an animated skeleton!~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a910 SAY ~[ARAN] I can promise you right proper, Sheena, I am not puttin' you off.

IF ~~ a911 SAY ~[ARAN] Hey, none o' that sharp eyed glare, Kachiko. I'll gladly talk wi' you another time. By your Eight Million Kara-Turan Gods, I didn't mean to offend you none. Not all o' us have your Dragon Tongue's focus, you know. I needs must concentrate, or I'll be not attendin' to my duties well enough. I'm not a Sword Saint or anythin'.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a912 SAY ~[ARAN] An' by Lolth's Lengthy Legs, keep away from me, you heartless drow bitch. I'm not one o' your filthy spider-spawn males to order about, Xulaye, cover or no cover. You want somethin', you put it through <CHARNAME>, done correct on th' chain o' command.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a913 SAY ~[ARAN] I don't have naught to say to you nohow, Yasraena. You seem to be backin' <CHARNAME>, an' I see why. But the only good drow is... well, I'm not so sure I should finish that statement. Just stay where I can watch you, an' don't try to talk me up, an' I won't cause you no trouble.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a914 SAY ~[ARAN] Now, don't you be gettin' mad, there, Zaiya. I'm right interested in what you have to say. An' you are a right fine lookin' lassie, too, though sometimes it be dangerous to be around one o' those 'surges' o' yours...~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a915 SAY ~[ARAN] Not that I'm puttin' you off for no reason, Kelsey. Come an' talk another time. I spent plenty o' time punchin' fists, Coster tradin' up an' down th' Sword Coast as a lad. We should talk shop some time soon, eh? I never did run a store, though I have done my share o' accountin' a' contract drafts. Reminds me o' th' good old days, when you raised an alarm for a stray urchin, a pickpocket, or a kobold or two, instead o' all the beasts th' nine hells can throw at us.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a916 SAY ~[ARAN] Tymora's Tantalizing Tits, you got a huge bundle o' nerve talkin' to me, Bruce m'boyo. You owe *me* two platinum orbs an' the names o' three reliable courtesans, an' you haven't paid up yet. Bugger off until you do, you lazy bastard!~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a917 SAY ~[ARAN] Tell you what, Auren - talk to me later, an' we'll have a go at that attack an' counter routine we had a few days ago. You are winnin' three falls to two, an' I would rightly enjoy balancin' out th' game, so to speak.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a918 SAY ~[ARAN] An' don't you be startin' in on me about th' corruption magic causes, neither, Kindrek. I'll take whatever weapon th' gods hand me, if it gets the job done proper. An' one more word about my head decoratin' a pike bein' pretty, an' we'll just have to see if that fancy weapon o' yours will be stronger than my skills, boyo.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a919 SAY ~[ARAN] Sarah, lass-o-me-heart, I don't mean to be short wi' you. I'll make it up to you later. I can fix some decent flatbread an' honey, just like they serve back near Beregost, an' mayhap I can bribe you for a story or two. You keep too quiet, lass, an' I do appreciate your friendship.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a920 SAY ~[ARAN] On second thought, stay away, Kova. I'm not particular about my company, but in your case, I'm up for makin' exceptions. I'm not sayin' guilty, I'm not sayin' innocent - I'm just sayin' naught.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a921 SAY ~[ARAN] An' keep your Master O' th' Universe crap out o' my face, wonderboy. <CHARNAME> killed you once, remember? In my opinion, it were done too slowly, an' wi' not enough o' th' pain an' sufferin' on your part.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a922 SAY ~[ARAN] I'm not likely to have nothin' to say anyways, Amber. It seems like you are backin' <CHARNAME>, but while you ca take the lady out o' th hells, now, can you really take th' hells out o' th' lady? I don't rightly trust no tiefling, no matter how pretty.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a923 SAY ~[ARAN] Chende, I'm, err... well, I'm... not that I have anythin' against half-orcs, or nothin, on account o' I have worked wi' my share o' right proper comrades what's got my back as good as I watch theirs, regardless o' orcish blood. It's just you keep adjustin' your top, an' it bothers me a bit. There's a good healthy woman, an' then there's a need to get some clerical intervention. That's just not right, eh?~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a924 SAY ~[ARAN] Ariena, don't be lookin' like that at me. I'm not shunnin' you, I just don't rightly have th' time right now! We'll try some sparrin' later on. Though this time, you done got to remember that we be sparrin', not fightin' for real. Last time, you bloody well busted a few o' my ribs.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a925 SAY ~[ARAN] An' no, I'm not interested in more discussions about Cyric an' his Dark Light, Kido. You spin a fine tale, but I'm stickin' wi' <CHARNAME> for <PRO_HISHER> sake, not on account o' any love for murder, death destruction, chaos, an' all that crap.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a926 SAY ~[ARAN] An' give me back my coinpurse, there, stickyfingers. Umberlee's Undulating Urges, Hessa, you should be lookin' for other marks, not messin' wi' my flat purse. <CHARNAME>'s holdin' all my share!~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a927 SAY ~[ARAN] An' don't you be goin' all 'Ducky This' an' 'Ducky That' wi', me, Linton. You're a right fine woman, but I figure you're a mite too streetwise to come roll in th' hay wi' th' like o' me.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a928 SAY ~[ARAN] Now, you want me to carry that kitty cat o' yours about, I'm your man. An' I wouldn't mind a few riddles, nether, Tashia. How about when we camp, I wander on by an' we have a nice conversation, private-like. I'll brew some decent tea...~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a929 SAY ~[ARAN] Come by later, though, 'Fletcher. We never did finish talkin' about that whole Trade Way skirmish wi' the Chill hittin' your squad o' Fist. I heard from Valis your party done got ambushed right proper, but fought all th' way out wi' only two casualties anyways. Now that is a story worth hearin' more'n once, it is. I'll provide th' spirits, you provide th' stories.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a930 SAY ~[ARAN] I mean no disrespect, o'course, m'Lady Ninde. I wouldn't want to be on th' wrong side o' one o' your tongue lashin's. Though if there's a right side, well, I'm your man for to call on. I'll just go get that gear straightened out a bit, eh?~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a931 SAY ~[ARAN] Yeah, yeah, I done heard you th' first twenty times. 'Tiax Rules All'. 'When Tiax Rules, Aran Will Be Th' Boot-Scraper An' Will Have To Talk To Me'. Sune's Rambunctious Rump, someone get this insane shorty th' Nine Hells away from me.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a932 SAY ~[ARAN] No offense, Xan, but I want to keep my spirits up, eh? You are one powerful Tel Quessir, but you sure can bring on th' doom an' gloom.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a933 SAY ~[ARAN] Beggin' your pardon, m'lady Deheriana. I don't mean no offense to you nor your Ranger.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a934 SAY ~[ARAN] I'm downright flattered you want to talk to me, I am, Kivan - I don't mean no disrespect. There's just not rightly no time now for talkin'.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a935 SAY ~[ARAN] An' don't you be pesterin' me about all that cookin' wi' meat again, Allison. I know you be fond o' th' animals, but there's a right good purpose for them there bunny rabbits. Make good stew, they do!~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a936 SAY ~[ARAN] Beggin' your pardon, o' course, vanimaberylellie en amin... no offense meant. I'd Like it fine if we could talk later, Kitanya. I'd like to learn some o' th' Tel Quessirim fightin' tactics, if you've a mind to share.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a937 SAY ~[ARAN] In fact, forget it. Shut your foul mouth, you Cyric-lovin' filth. If <CHARNAME> didn't keep you on a tight leash like some pet, I'd be servin' your heart up tartar-style, wi' a nice cup o' th' blood o' innocents you like to murder. Watch your back, bastard, on account o' I'm just waitin' for th' opportunity to plant somethin' between your third an' fourth ribs.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a938 SAY ~[ARAN] Hold on... I can do this right proper, I can. I've been readin'. *ahem*. Forsooth, it pains me greatly to cause you distress, my Lady Saerileth. But thy words best not the needs of the moment, and I must away anon. Perchance thy gracious lips would caress mine ears at the first pale glimmer of starlight; for in thine countenance I do see the beauty of life, the vivaciousness of youth, and the satin power of Tyr enobl'd and made feminine in the grace of your form. This poor sinner doth confess the lusts of both body and mind for such sweet discourse; a breath, a moment of your beauty is like the drop of divine wisdom from the countenance of Ao. *ahem*. Sune's Salacious Succulence, talkin' that way'll kill a man dead, it will.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a939 SAY ~[ARAN] Come by an' talk later, though, Yikari. We can get a good stiff drink, an' loosen that still tongue o' yours. I want to hear more about th' far off lands, an' especially those Kara-Turan womenfolk!~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a940 SAY ~[ARAN] Bugger all, Bruce, I told you I was tapped out clean. No coin, no trade bars, nothin'. Hells, man, here - take this flask. An' don't be drinkin' it straight in one shot, or it'll put you right over on your ares. Cut it wi' some water. Now leave me alone 'til payday!~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a941 SAY ~[ARAN] Not meanin' to offend you, Sime, nor your father. I'd be right happy if you'd come talk later on. Perhaps I can buy you a drink or somethin', next opportunity. No pass, honest, just interested in swappin' some stories, playin' some dice, passin' the time.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a942 SAY ~[ARAN] I'm up for a mite o' a chat later, though, Neh'Taniel. You talk a deep set o' subjects, you do. I need most o' my mind on th' discussion if I want to keep up, eh?~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a943 SAY ~[ARAN] Oh, I'm right sorry, I am. Skooter, I did promise a throw or two o' that stick, didn't I. Right then, here you go... one good toss down that way. Just don't get lost, eh, m'boyo? There's critters around here what could eat *me* for a light snack, let alone you.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a944 SAY ~[ARAN] I'm not that interested in talkin' to no drow, nohow, Solaufein. You may talk a good game, but me, I got both my eyes on you. Figuratively speakin' that is. It'd be a mite messy if I done popped 'em out an' stuck em' to you.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a945 SAY ~[ARAN] An' in any case, you'll be wantin' to talk to <CHARNAME>, not me.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a946 SAY ~[ARAN] An' by Lolth's Lengthy Legs, keep away from me, you heartless drow bitch. I'm not one o' your filthy spider-spawn males to order about, Xulaye, cover or no cover. You want somethin', you put it through <CHARNAME>, done correct on th' chain o' command.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a947 SAY ~[ARAN] Not meanin' to be short, m'darlin lassie, but I'd rather we have a talk later. Are you up for a walk tonight, Aerie? Mayhap just you an' me, under th' stars?~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a948 SAY ~[ARAN] Anomen, if this is about my gear bein' not quite tidy enough, I done rightly heard you the first three times. An' I'll say it again - I don't answer to you, nohow. So bugger on about your business, m'lord, an' leave me to mine.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a949 SAY ~[ARAN] If it that talk you were wantin' to give me on th' ways o' th' birds an' th' bees, Cernd, well - that ship sailed a couple o' years ago. Though I can tell you o' some things I've learned what's great in th' bedroom, but don't quite fit under th' headin' o 'natural'...~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a950 SAY ~[ARAN] Unless it be more stories o' your conquests, o' course, Edwin. You got more o' those, well, step right on over, an' we'll have a mite o' a chat. I still can't rightly believe a Chondathan girl can be trained to do what you described last time. Didn't know they bent that way.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a951 SAY ~[ARAN] An' lay of th' 'sparrowhawk', 'dovewing', an' birdy-birdy language for a mite, there, HaerDalis, eh? If you do, I'll let you look at a scrap o' parchment I found in a library outside o' Beregost, what's written in th' tongue o' Gold Dwarves...~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a952 SAY ~[ARAN] I'm not pushin' you away, Imoen, really I'm not. I just know you have a mite on your mind, too, an' I'm not happy company right now. I'll walk by you for a bit, though, if you want.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a953 SAY ~[ARAN] Yes, Jaheira, I packed up my bedroll right tightly. No, Jaheira, I did not eat too much o' th' hardtack, an' cramp my bowels. Yes, Jaheira, I read that list o' spices you wanted me to try to get into th' dinner roster. Mielikki's Mysterious Mouth, I'm no bloody half-elf out o' your loins, I'm just a friend, eh? Go easy on th' motherin', for th' love of our friendship!~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a954 SAY ~[ARAN] Tell you what, Jan. If th' story is about turnips, relatives, or craftin' new inventions, I can tell you I done heard it. In fact, if it was turnips, I done heard it twice. But we will have time to take on meal prep, an' then you can tell me about th' time the cute female turnip golem who was really your third cousin on your uncle's side managed to get you an idea for an invention what turned out to be th' best thing since th' gods created womenfolk.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a955 SAY ~[ARAN] I don't mean no disrespect, Keldorn. If you have somethin' you want me to do, just say the word. Otherwise, I need to attend to my duties right proper.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a956 SAY ~[ARAN] If this is about th' sharpenin' bar, Korgan, here it is. I don't need it no more nohow. An' I'm not so happy wi' havin' to rent it for two iron crescents an' a Trademeet trade bar. Xvim's Spit, that's bloody highway robbery.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a957 SAY ~[ARAN] I'll be happy to help on th' weapons cleanin' later, though, Mazzy. I want to see how you sharpen those arrows so fierce.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a958 SAY ~[ARAN] Oh, I'm right sorry, Minsc - didn't mean to be so short. Though when I'm standin' close to you, short is the word what springs to mind right quick, it does. You are blockin' most o' my view, big boy. You mind steppin' over a bit, so's I can see where we are headed?~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a959 SAY ~[ARAN] An' I am not one o' th' Great Unwashed Little People, neither, Nalia. I 'll have you know I took a bath just last week. Well, parts o' me, anyways. Wanna see?~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a960 SAY ~[ARAN] I'm right surprised you want to talk, anyways, Valygar. You haven't put two words together wi' me in nigh on a tenday.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a961 SAY ~[ARAN] On second thought, Viconia, don't even bother. I've got naught to say to a Shar-kissed spawn o' th' Nether Planes. Bugger off an' go screw an ettin, or somethin'.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a962 SAY ~[ARAN] Tell you what, Yoshimo - we'll talk next time we camp. I want to try that card game again. I don't rightly know how you won all five hands, an' I want a chance to make some o' those wages back.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a1652 SAY ~[ARAN] We'll be talkin' over dinner prep anyways, Hubelpot. Don't worry none - I'll try not to get ripped limb from limb afore then, and with a bit o' luck, you won't be ground up bits o' parts neither. We can talk about real curry makin'!~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a1653 SAY ~[ARAN] You can't rightly expect much in th' way o' small talk from me, nohow, Iylos. You got a mission, an' I respect that. But fish around for information about <CHARNAME> from someone else. I don't serve more than one contract at a time, an' <CHARNAME> has that right now, an' probably 'til I'm arguin' wi' Kelemvor myself on where the prettiest girl souls be hidin' out.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a1654 SAY ~[ARAN] You should know better than to sneak up on me like that, Banana. I got me a ton o' recipes wi' your name on 'em... hey, you got a cousin named Rosanna Bananadana?~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a1657 SAY ~[ARAN] Easy, there, lass - don't you be gatherin' your tail in a twist, an' all. Literally, I mean. You are blushin' redder than I done seen in a tenday! Kari, I'm just busy now, that's all. Come by when we settle in for th' night, an' I'll help you with that weapon sharpenin' you were askin' about.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a1658 SAY ~[ARAN] How about you come by tonight, though, Keto, an' we trade some stories? I'd be lyin' if I didn't think I'd make you nice company. I have some nice Rashemi Firewine set aside, not even watered down...~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a1659 SAY ~[ARAN] Now then, miss foxy lass, I don't have no problems wi' talkin' to you, but now is not rightly th' time. Come by at dinner, Moddy, an' we'll share a bit o' talk, eh? Or better yet, a nice brace 'o rabbits.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a1660 SAY ~[ARAN] Outsider an' necromancer... there's naught about you that sits right wi' me, Tsujatha. I' m tolerant for <CHARNAME>'s sake, an' that's about it. So don't look for small talk an' comradeship here.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END

Working as both Pen and Sword (scribe and fighting guard) made him attractive as an independent, since he could balance accounts, keep inventory, and still operate as a sellsword. A few campaigns with mercenary companies, a few battles, and lots of wandering about has brought him to Amn. He hastens to note that he is not the man to send in to negotiate anything, preferring to wield weapons rather than the spoken word - but if you want a trading contract written up, he's the right man for the job.% [C-BLANK],74) /* BIO */

IF ~~ a1110 SAY ~[ARAN] I'm right fine wi' my own, thanks, though I appreciate th' sentiment. Truth be told, I'm not much o' a standard-bearer in any order. Mostly, I get used as the 'how-not-to' demonstration.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a1111 SAY ~[ARAN] HEY! (Ducks frantically and flails his arms).~ = ~[ARAN] Scared th' crap right out o' me, there, <CHARNAME>.

An' th' damned fool came along an' brought me into the order, claimin' he could not go back on his word, made in front o' his god an' all.~ = ~[ARAN] I tried to let him know officers promise all sorts o' crap all the time to get men an' women to lay down their lives - it be part o' the job. But I didn't have th' heart to say no to the lad, he seemed so serious. So, here I be, the swearin'est, dirtiest, roughest son o' a bitch to be put in the Order.

IF ~~ a1134 SAY ~[ARAN] Well, I marched through here once, on a day contract. Local merchant house wanted to make a big splash, an' hired a bunch o' sellswords to wear pink an' purple livery an' guard a carriage through town.~ = ~[ARAN] It did not work out well, though. When the crowd weren't laughin', they were lookin' at all the finery, an' seein' little in th' way o' armor. Rival house took advantage, an' beat the lot o' us, dumped the carriage, an' dumped the poor passenger in the mud.~ = ~[ARAN] Learned a good lesson that day, too... don't be tryin' to punch a man in the mouth what wears full plate.

Figured any god called 'Unseein' was also 'Unfeelin', so I gave it a wide berth.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a1139 SAY ~[ARAN] With my language? No way. All I heard was someone was causin' some troubles for the three big temples here, an' there was a rumor they might be in th' market for some hirin'. I gave it a wide berth, as religious wars, well... they don't ever end.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END

Sure looks different now.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a1146 SAY ~[ARAN] No, I can't say I have. I stuck mostly to th' coast, workin' short haul an' stayin' close to Calimport.

I learned in Calimport that th' best remedy for aught that ails a man is to bathe every day, even if it be in a splash o' water from a bucket. Better to go for a strong swim, but I'll take what I can get. An' tangled hair don't rightly help when there's a head wound.

IF ~~ a1181 SAY ~[ARAN] I'd be right happy to, <CHARNAME>. Now you were talkin' swords, or daggers? Or perhaps a mite o' hand-to-hand? I don't suppose you mean lipwrestlin', but a man has to hold out hope, he does...~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END
IF ~~ a1182 SAY ~[ARAN] (Aran's gaze sweeps your body, leaving nothing uninspected. His low whistle turns quickly to a cough.) You'll do right fine, you will. Nothin' out o' place, not nowhere. Gear's all set in right proper.~ IF ~~ THEN EXIT END

And pretty soon I was much engaged,
In charting all her charms

The keyhole in her door.

That night I rode in glorious style,
And other things besides,
And on her lily white stomach, Boys,

But when I woke next morning, Boys,

  SAY ~[ARAN] So, my first time visitin' Calimport. I had signed on wi' a ship haulin' furs, headed to that jewel o' th' hells they call a city. Short trip, good row, only one day under sail, no stops. We pull around the western tip and head for the city, and the captain's so happy he calls me up to watch (or so I thought. The three big war galleys from the Pasha or Caliph, or whatever they call the boss around there might have made him nervous when they pulled along a parallel course. He kept grinnin' and whisperin' for me to keep an eye on the passengers). We pull in, he pays me off an' tries to short me, but one of the passengers saw and headed off trouble by tossin' me a purse.~
  = ~[ARAN] Not wantin' to cause no hassle, I just left. It really didn't matter, anyways... Calimport was so huge, I spent the first hour just gettin' off of the *docks*. I gawked too much, I guess, because by the time I had gotten to th' warehouses to see if there was work, someone had slit that purse the passenger gave me and emptied it. Saved me a night of drinkin', anyways. But for a big city, the place didn't have much work. I found out they have a tight bound Guild, th' hard way, by askin' a scribe an' gettin' bounced on my arse for it by his 'protection'. So most copywork be done through hagglin' with a guild representative at a bazaar (their word for a disorganized mess o' a marketplace, where it looks like no honest trader would consider setting foot). Needless to say, I was not th' first on any worklist, bein' outsider, an' not bein' able to pay a huge Guild fee.~
  = ~[ARAN] I got lucky, though. I saw a sign in a window looking for a stablehand, and when I went in, there was an argument in progress. The innkeeper, or whatever they called him (later on, I called him boss to his face an' 'stupid blighted bastard' behind his back), was just finishin' off th' argument with his bookkeeper by shovin' some sort of curved dagger-like thing through th' bookkeeper's back. He screamed something about Entreri being angry, or somethin', and the place stopped like one o' Graf's clocks. I froze, too, on account o' everyone else did, but I guess I kind of stood out, or somethin' - mayhap I didn't look scared enough or somethin'. Anyways, he looked right at me, his eyes lit up, and he asked me if I wanted a job.~
  = ~[ARAN] I said yes. He rolled the body off of the table, an' told me to go down the street to some office and tell them I was from the Ten Veils, and that the paperwork was on its way, and then if I survived that to go to the guild and get a new bookkeeper. Well, I saw an opportunity, and told him I was ok with numbers. Long an' short o' it, he hired me for room an' board and a little coin, an' paid my Guild fee, too. Said it was cheaper this way, and told me to look for the other set of books an' get a fair accountin'. Apparently those folks just don't understand numbers, on account o' it looked like huge sets o' coin were just completely missin'. Either that, or someone was takin' a Dragon's share o' coin under th' table an' makin' it disappear.  Luckily, the boss had someone else to blame besides me, an' a body to prove his good intentions to whomever were lookin' to see where all th' coin went, so I was set for a few weeks. Then I met this redheaded lass named Kiera, an'... well, that be a different story.~
