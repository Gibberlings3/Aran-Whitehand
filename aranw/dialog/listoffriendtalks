FT 10 sets up a "shoot hoops FR-style" for Male PCs (no way of turning it into a romance) and a "moonlit sparring" encounter for female PC's (can end up having a flig with him even if not in a romance, or simply fight him for fun).
This is added "scenery' content, and does not reset the FT timer. Perhaps is should?

/*  SoA UnderDark
/Volumes/SCV/aranw/dialog/c-arandialog.d
/*  SoA UnderDark FriendTalk 1 : Nightmares on Elm Street */
/*  SoA UnderDark FriendTalk 2 : Moving Bowels */
/*  SoA UnderDark FriendTalk 3 : Don't Look Now, but your Isaiah 2:19 is showing... */
/*  SoA UnderDark FriendTalk 4 : Weather forecast for tonight... dark. (George Carlin) */
/*  SoA UnderDark FriendTalk 5 : "I believe that forgiving them is God's function. Our job is to arrange the meeting." ("Stormin'" Norman Schwarzkopf)*/

at the 30 minute timer, talks cover 7 hours of SoA outside of underdark and 2 hours 30 minutes in underdark. 
at the 60 (default), of course, 14 hours outside and 5 hours drow-ing. 

For the female PC, these play out as well if the PC doesn't shut down the romance: 

/* BG2 Love Talk

Need to finish romance arc for SoA; with the huge, way-over the top flirting possibilities, the occasional non-sequential scenery talks, the interjections, and the banters, it is a darned good thing much of that can be shut off via PID. The adult materials (including extensions to the streams, baths, garden, Inn, the "booty call through PID in a romance" and "the Romantic Encounters sparked from PC response in FT or LT") are almost finished, though it has been draft after draft and I'm less than thrilled - but hey, I wanted a challenge.

/* 9 - danger

/* 10 - crisis

/* 11 - resolution before ToB
