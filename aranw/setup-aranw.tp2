He explains that he grew up in a small independent family-run Coster plying the Trade Way and Coast Way from Waterdeep both north and south. Working as both Pen and Sword (scribe and fighting guard) made him attractive as an independent, since he could balance accounts, keep inventory, and still operate as a sellsword. A few campaigns with mercenary companies, a few battles, and lots of wandering about has brought him to Amn. He hastens to note that he is not the man to send in to negotiate anything, preferring to wield weapons rather than the spoken word - but if you want a trading contract written up, he's the right man for the job.~ [c-aran44]

I read your message with great happiness. Congratulations on your being advanced to choice! By the time you read this there will only be a few more months and you will be in your final year of apprenticeship. And Mystra is a good Goddess to serve, I hear. I always thought you would lean towards The Wise One, Oghma, and go with the Estelmer family nobility as benefactors, but you know your own heart. If your calling is to Mystra, then I guess you couldn't do any better than to Eltorchul family. There are some stories about a few of them, but they generally get written about as good people, for nobles and wands. Good but not lockstep; some of them are pretty wild, if trail stories and news broadsides talk about the same family. The Thunderstaffs follow Mystra, but from my end - plenty of warmages from that family, that is for sure! I was pretty sure you wouldn't end up following them, anyways. I am really glad your benefactor was happy, too. I thought it was like a trade apprenticeship, and you would be with The Lady Mage all the way. I guess I didn't understand about the schools, and how you work your way up.
I love the emerald, and I will figure out what you mean about saying the inscriptions in private once we are on the trail. I hope this isn't one of your practical jokes, though. That is too fine a gem just to put a joke on. And the colors were beautiful. It lasted a full thirty seconds before dissolving into smoke, and it was a deep, shiny green with gold and silver and sky blue. Plus, it only erased a little bit of the parchament, so I got to read most of the message. That is so much better than the one where you tried the acid-flowers, and it burned through the whole letter. I know you want to have each message destroy itself, though I do not understand why all mages seem to need such secrecy.
I do have some news. I have started working with a new group. There is not much to say yet, but it is not a regular mercenary group. <CHARNAME>, the one who leads, is different. I will have more to say later, I am sure. In the meantime, keep up your studies, and I will try to send you some of the spell components you asked about as best I can. Judging by the look of things, I may be able to get some very rare components for you just by keeping my eyes open and wits sharp.
	Yours Faithfully, Aran~

I am writing from the trail, so please excuse the occasional blot or crease staining the writing. There is so much to report, but most of it is not to be trusted to letters. When I next see you, remind me to tell you about <PLAYER1>. Things are working out well enough on so far. Well as well as can be expected given our challenges. I have not had as much combat in so short a timeframe since the pitched battles back near Baldur's Gate. Even in the Axes, there were months with no combat, and now it seems to happen every day.
I am glad to hear that your roommate is not making your life easy. I know that sounds unsupportive, and I am sure you don't appreciate it, but from my standpoint it means you are telling me things and not hiding the challenges and problems. You are smart enough to get past this. Just don't do what you did to Kimili when she called you those names. I bet now that you have some real training, it would not be a few curls set on fire... you might accidentally incinerate her head.
I did hear from Nathan the other day, and his letter asked after you. I told him you were away in the Dale lands, rather than the truth. I know you think that he is cute, but I know him. He is not a nice person. I may sound overprotective, but he has done some things you just do not want to know about.
Well, I must close, as I am out of room, and low on supplies. Time to mix up some more ink, too. As always.

I hope that all is well with you. For me, I am sorely in need of your guidance. I know we have written about this several times, but I need to clear my head and think and you are always good at helping me do that. I cannot stop thinking about her. I cannot stop watching her. It has me off balance, even worse than when I fell for that half-elven bard you warned me against. I simply do not understand how I could be pulled so far under her spell in such a short time. I know I am not an apprentice, but I certainly feel like one. I know I wrote to you of my feelings, and I know we joked about the difficulties of falling for one's employer, but now I am serious.
I do not know if you would like her, or not. But do not believe the stories that must be floating around about what we are doing. All I can say is that she has captivated my attention in a way no other woman has. Yes, even more than SilverEyes. I just have difficulties seeing what I can offer her in return. I have no wealth or title, no real prospects, and I do not even know if she truly would have me. But that is how serious my situation seems to have become. For Sune's Blessing and for the love of your brother, help me. I need to know what a woman of power really wants.
	Yours faithfully, Aran~

I hope that all is well with you, and with your pet lizard (yes, I know he is a pseudodragon, but someone has to put her in her place!). I am happy your work in runescribing is coming along, but please remember about spell duration. Half of your last message burned through your last three letters to me, and nearly turned my pack into a bonfire. I know you prefer secrecy, but surely I can keep one or two of your missives?
There are many things going on right now, and I am not at liberty to write much about them. Our goals are being met, though the victories seem very costly. Perhaps it is more that I have made a stronger committment to this quest than I have before. Your advice was appreciated. I am happy you see me that way, but I am pretty sure that you did not really mean "just kiss her and keep kissing her until she either kills you or professes her love". I understand what you are saying about power being of many kinds, and that sometimes just being yourself is what she might need. I do not know the best way to proceed right now, but I will take your advice under advisement and continue as best I can.
In the meantime, I will be enclosing a small packet of wildspeare flowers for your component pouch when I get a chance to send this. I hope that it helps your studies. Please try not to turn Jill into a flowerpot again. I know that the polymorph spell usually results in squirrels, berrygobblers, or chipmunks rather than inanimate objects, so study hard and next time it might go better.
	Yours faithfully, Aran.~

I understand what you are saying about power being of many kinds, and that sometimes just being yourself is what she might need. I do not know the best way to proceed right now, but I will take your advice under advisement and continue as best I can.
In the meantime, I will be enclosing a small packet of wildspeare flowers for your component pouch when I get a chance to send this. I hope that it helps your studies. Please try not to turn Jill into a flowerpot again. I know that the polymorph spell usually results in squirrels, berrygobblers, or chipmunks rather than inanimate objects, so study hard and next time it might go better.
	Yours faithfully, Aran.~

Congratulations on winning your competition! I had no idea that things were so competitive at the academy, and I am very glad that the Priests of Ilmater were there when that boy got caught in the fireball. I am so happy you won, and you even gave me ideas for a new set of tactics to use. I doubt I will often be able to spread oil or grease before a battle, but the use of multiple layers of magic is not something I have studied very much. The way things are going around here, we may need all the tactical advantages I can come up with.
As for your enquiries, she is holding her own against the power of her blood. I do not have any real answers for you as to whether she sees me as someone who she could be with forever, or just someone she can use temporarily. I hear her words, and I see her responses, but I often am not quite sure where she really is coming from. She may be shouting her truth at me all the time, for all I know, but I am simply not sure if I am hearing reality or something I have constructed all in my head. You know as well as I do that I have done that before, and the results have been less than positive.
There will be time enough to write more later. I will be enclosing a few odds and ends gleaned from our last few combats, but i am unsure as to how to stop them from breaking when transported to you. If the letter you are holding is a bright black on one corner, then I would seek out the Priests for healing immediately. I am never sure why you want me to send you these things, as my training has been in writing, not herbalism, but you know that I would do anything for you.
	Yours faithfully, Aran~

I hope my letter finds you in good health and spirits. I will get straight to the point and remind you that you are too special and to smart to fall into any traps. Be careful. I do not know anything about Court and have never really seen a Masked Lord or even an un-masked one, but I have been around long enough to be suspicious of anyone who makes bold passes at you. I wish I were there, so that he would know that you have a protector. I know you can take care of yourself, but it still worries me. If you need proof, remember how I have acted around Giselle and Rani, and how you had to send a spark at me to stop me from behaving badly with your friends.
Yes, I know I have a double standard, but I have always been very interested in all of this romantic sparking, while you have avoided it like the plague. And our situations are not as similar as you made it sound. <CHARNAME> is more complicated than what we are talking about. If it were just for fun, that would be one thing, but I seem to have developed some attachments that make things more painful for me if I do things that she might not like. I always try to fit what she seems to want, but it is hard sometimes. In fact, it seems almost impossible at times. But I trust in Tymora, and She will make the coin toss. What is meant to be, is meant to be. In your case, though, your benefactor might not take kindly to that particular young man. Do not take this the wrong way, but you have to ask yourself if he is really interested in you, or if he wants information.
I trust you to make the right choice for you, of course. I would send for you to join us for a little bit, so you could get away and think, but I am afraid things here have gotten very difficult. Our adversaries are the stuff of legends and folktales, only they turn out to be real. Usually, they also turn out to be able to crush me into goo. No matter what is going on there, things are worse here. Do not worry for me, though. I have allways had an eye out for trouble, and I think I enjoy feeling part of something that will make a difference.
	Yours faithfully, Aran~

	Greetings and salutations. While I appreciated receipt of the draft copy of your work in the timely fashion requested, the nature of this particular story has run afoul of some unforseen challenges in its editorial review and publication. Due to the graphic nature of its contents, we have had to procure the services of a freelance editor and adjust our initial ideas of moarketing and publication run.
	We have decided that the initial twenty copy run is insufficient, and will undertake to dramatically increase the number of copies created. However, we feel that the work would be better served by mass publication on woodpulp, rather than the more expensive vellum. We esimate that the initial facination with salacious content presented in written form will not have the lasting and enduring effect of more standard novelizations, and that after the initial sales the use of this work is far more likely to be in creating bonfires than in literary review. We believe that the bardic tradition of expanding and retelling will soon make your character's trials and tribulations popular, but the retelling will likely leave the book unsellable.
	We look forward to your second draft, with particular attention to the rewrites and edits suggested in the accompanying document.

	With eager anticipation of our mutual profit,

	Wordsmith Lourd, Bookseller and Printer, The Promenade, Athalka, Amn~
