        "float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" /> This is the first &quot;real&quot; release, but Aran has been wandering around various
        installs for over a decade now. I hope you enjoy the &quot;final&quot; product as much as I have enjoyed writing and coding
        him. Thanks to all of the members of the i.e. modding community who have contributed in lots of cool ways to this
        project.<br />
        <br />
        <b>The Mod Concept</b><br />
        NPCs work in many different ways, based primarily on the original BioWare model. What happens, though, if we try a more
        &#39;self aware&#39; NPC, allowing player choice for some of the fundamentals? Is an NPC&#39;s character his class and
        stats, or is it really a personality? Can an NPC still be true to himself, even when a player chooses to turn them into a
        new class combination? This mod explores the idea that jobs may come and go, and in the heart of an accountant may lie a
        lion, even if the body doesn&#39;t quite show it off. The NPC should be able to adapt to being a new class or kit
        combination, while retaining his core personality. As a side project, the intent is to post code in the forum to eventually
        tie to tutorials and provide insight into the decisionmaking process when turning an idea into functional code.<br />
        Aran Whitehand is functionally a Companion mod. He has minor optional quests with a new area, but comes with no special
        weapons or upgradeable items - his specialty is in interacting with the members of the party and adapting to situations.
        For him, the job is paramount, and his job is supporting the player. He is no stranger to having to carry out orders which
        bend morality, though he hates doing so. It should be noted that this mod is designed by adults for adults, and should not
        be installed unless you are comfortable with Faerunian swearing, occasional adult themes, and NC - 17 to R rated content in
        the Romance portion.</p>

        <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup!
        If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the
        mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game&#39;s folder into a new
        one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG:EE it is important that you install the mod to the
        language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error
        messages.</p>

        <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Aran Whitehand for Windows (aranw) is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install,
        simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href=
        "http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly
        extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-aranw.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>arranw</strong>. To
        install, double-click <strong>setup-aranw.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>

        <p>You can run <strong>setup-aranw.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change
        components.</p>

        <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        Aran Whitehand (aranw) for Mac OS X *** will eventually be *** distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU
        installer.</p>

        <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will
        contain <strong>setup-aranw</strong>, <strong>setup-aranw.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>aranw</strong>. To
        install, double-click <strong>setup-aranw.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>

        <p>You can run <strong>setup-aranw.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change
        components.</p>

        <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Aran Whitehand for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>

        <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>

        <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy
        WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower and
        answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you&#39;ve already ran it once in the same
        directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there&#39;s no need to run the first option (lowercasing file
        names) either if you&#39;ve extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you&#39;re unsure,
        running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>

        <p>To install, run WeInstall amber in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing.</p>

        <p><strong>Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-aranw
        --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. .</p>

        <h2>The Companion NPC</h2>

        <p><b>Aran Whitehand</b> is a human fighter and scribe for BG2, dual classable, so that he can be Tinker, Tailor, Soldier,
        Spy... whatever your party needs. Basically, a human utility player taken along for the friendship/cuddling.
        &quot;Specials&quot; include creation of scrolls through dialog and timer when in a party with another canonical mage.
        Primarily a male friend who can grow into an extended courtship/romance, romanceable by female PCs, Aran has his own sense
        of humor and specializes in bringing others into the conversation.</p>

        12 Charisma<br /></p>

        <h2>Friendship</h2>

        <p>Aran will befriend any protagonist of any race or alignment,though how he reacts to situations will definitely let the
        player know how he feels. A rough - around - the - edges man, accustomed to mercenary sevice and caravan work both in front
        of and protecting the books, Aran hires on as a scribe or accountant as well as protection. He has learned to work with
        practically anyone not Drow, and chase any female within arms reach. His language is rough, his approach unrefined. And if
        you don&#39;t like it, he will gladly tell you exactly what your opinion is worth.</p>

        <h2>Romance</h2>

        <p>Aran will romance any female protagonist of any race save Drow, or any alignment. Again, how he reacts will definitely
        let the player understand his position. Good men fall for bad women as quickly as for good ones, and sometimes opposites
        really do attract. But romance on the trail is awkward, with a group of adventurers around, and the road to romance is both
        rocky and complicated. Exactly how does a strong man feel when his significant other turns out to be infinitely stronger
        than he, on so many levels? Can the two of you negotiate the attraction into something of an equal relationship, or is this
        destined to fail? For a sample of lovetalks, please visit the forums.</p>

        <p style="color:red">WARNING. FEMALE PC ROMANCE CAN BE &quot;NOT SAFE FOR WORK&quot;.</p>

        <p>Although your female PC has many opportunities to manage the physical side of the relationship and can always shut him
        down or start him up, if a female player character romances him there is specific, detailed, graphic, poorly written fanfic
        smut that will make for a workplace conversation that you DO NOT want to have. If you have played Romantic Encounters for
        BG2, Sheri and Renal are relatively tame by comparison. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. (If you don&#39;t want it at all, play him
        with a male PC, and all will be completely fine.)</p>

        <h2>Joining the Party</h2>

        <p>When Aran Whitehand meets the party, he is looking for work having dropped from the rolls of a mercenary regiment. Look
        for him in the new inn &quot;The Broken Sword&quot;, found on the Promenade just North of the Adventurer&#39;s Mart and
        just West of the Circus Tents. The bouncer&#39;s name is Manson.</p>

        <p><strong>BETA USERS PLEASE NOTE: Aran&#39;s starting location is patched into the Promenade. Currently the code does not
        parse saved games to edit in his area;</strong> to get him, you need to start a new game or proceed from a save anywhere
        before first arriving on the Promenade (I often test from the initial dungeon saves).</p>

        <h2>Customization</h2>

        <p>In addition to setting Aran up as one four potential dual-class options, there are components to change his content
        timers, and his portrait in-game. You will be asked about those potential choices on install, but they are completely
        optional - his default install parameters are as follows: *****INSERT DEFAULT STUFF INFORMATION HERE LATER CMORGAN WAKE UP
        AND DO THIS BEFORE RELEASE.<br />
        Before your installation proceeds, you might want to take a look at your options under portraits shown below.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <ul>
          <li>The &quot;PiD&quot;, or &quot;Player Initiated Dialogue&quot; where you initiate conversation directly with Aran
          in-game, is your friend. You can do all sorts of things, including rewrite history. If you correct him, he will happily
          believe what you tell him is the absolute and gospel truth - and set his variables accordingly. (Don&#39;t you wish
          people were like that?)</li>

          <li>Hang around the Broken Sword for awhile, and you&#39;ll find table chatter. The non-joinable NPCs there have some
          conversations, too. Look for additional content there in later releases.</li>

          <li>Kick him out and take him back in in different ways, in different areas.</li>

          <li>Have a sparring session with him, friend or not, romance or not. All are different, and take advantage of
          RandomNumber generation, so... expect things to be different every playthrough.</li>

          <li>Ask him for advice in different areas.</li>

          <li>Get him drunk. Several times.</li>

          <li>Charm him, and chat...</li>

          <li>Romance: Play an evil female PC and treat him badly... scratch him, bite him, and see what he does.</li>

          <li>Romance: Get into an argument with him, and when he comes looking to make up, refuse. Or you could try apologising.
          Sometimes he actually accepts. Sometimes he apologises. Sometimes he is an ignorant prat and holds a grudge...</li>

          <li>Romance: The naughty bits are rather varied and exhaustive. Or at least they try to be. Encourage him, don&#39;t
          encourage him, make him work for it... play it however you like.</li>

          <li>Install Crossmod Banter Pack after all other NPC mods and some other mods like Divine Remix, and he will banter with
          mod added NPCs.</li>

          <li>Like their authors Berelinde and cmorgan, Gavin and Aran have a good friendship. As a result, there is more content,
          noth friendship and romance, between the two. Install Gavin before Aran, and you will have more content between the two
          of them.</li>

          <li>Play him on BGII:EE/EET. He has content and banters with the BeamHaul crowd, too.</li>

        <p>There is an entire community of folks to thank, for all sorts of reasons, so someone is going to get left out and I am
        going to be very embarrassed. But the folks who really make things fun when working through i.e. stuff, the folks who

        same 20 minutes. Thanks to CamDawg, Grim Squeaker, Smoketest, devSin, Wisp, Taimon, Ascension64, igi, eric, Steve, and
        Miloch, who all show me how things work and manage not to call me an ignorant jackass to my face (mostly). And infinite
        thanks to Nythrun, who showed me patience, great humor, and the power of &quot;just do it.&quot;</p>

        <p>And though he will make an obscene comment or involve Aran in a Dodecahedron Smut Mod in retaliation, special thanks to
        &quot;the bigg&quot;. Not just for years of patience and help, but for huge work behind the scenes to support, clean up,
        extend, and rebuild Weimer&#39;s Dialog Utility making it relevant and powerful for today&#39;s modders.</p>

        <p>On this specific project, huge thanks go to Berelinde, who has helped me bounce ideas, clean up/rebuild code, warned me
        when I was getting really gross, poked at me when I slacked, asked the &quot;duh&quot; questions that have set me on new
        paths, reminded me when I have started doing boneheaded things in code, and provided solid criticism. Jastey has been there
        regularly, giving great specific feedback; without these two strong modders as friends, working on and discussing things at
        Tolkein Across The Water, the biggest challenges in the mod would never have been attempted, let alone written. To the Two
        Mistresses of Modding Mayhem, I tip my cap in appreciation, and let you know that you have helped me get hours of enjoyment
        out of the modding challenge. It is great to work with you!</p>

        <p>Special thanks to Peachplums for her donated artwork - check her out at http://peachplums.deviantart.com/ and follow her
        work!</p>

        <p>Lots of people have helped out in this &quot;open code&quot; mod experiment, many with behind-the-scenes PMs that have
        opened new ideas or closed up old ones, others with clear and helpful bug and typo hunting, and still others with the
        ticklish and sensitive &quot;proofread the smut&quot; quotient. My appreciation is fierce. In most cases, my thanks has
        been to write specific pathways or open branches in response to their own particular personal protagonist preference (their
        &quot;ppp&quot;), but some angels have given feedback without indicating what they like in their ppp, so the only coin I
        have in repayent is acknowledgement of contribution. A partial list follows:</p>

        <p>This project has been a blast, even on days when I just wanted to throw it all in and go whack something in Mount &amp;
        Blade or take over the world in Civ III/IV/BTS/V/GK/VI/VI:Rise and Fall (the project took that long!!). That is entirely
        due to folks poking at Aran with long sticks, asking questions, giving feedback, and making me rethink things.</p>

        <p>Vox Vulgaris - middle ages with a twist. Source - The group. Selections clipped from three of their online materials,
        Cantiga 166, Rokatanc, and Saltarello. Pieces are in public domain, but the performance is copyrighted - probably shorter
        than the &quot;you are stealing this&quot; time index, but if an official someone objects for use in a free mod, I&#39;ll
        just use it on my own install. I have to thank the husband and wife team that developed mount &amp; Blade, because I
        didn&#39;t know there was such great midaevil re-covers from groups like Vox Vulgaris and Hungary Debrecen, until modders
        put them into their M&amp;B mods!</p>

        free mod, I&#39;ll take it out. But if you find one of their recordings, they are solid brass, more calm in their

        matter how much you want the mods to be part of your game experience, the only &quot;payment&quot; a modder gets is players
        commenting on their work. Their work, not your redefinition of it. The community can work cooperatively on content, and you
        can always build your own mods on top of an install without taking over other people&#39;s NPCs and Quests. Please think,
        and remember that however fiercely you want to tell your own story to the world, the other modders felt the same way. They
        refrained from messing about with your stuff. Please do the same for theirs.</p>
