  <div class="section">
    <p><img src="../media/portraits_bg2/nix_default_bg2m.bmp" alt="nix_defaultm.bmp" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" /> This
    is a first release, well tested on BGII - SoA (modded and unmodded), but not fully tested on BGII:EE. That means &quot;There
    Will Be Bugs(tm)&quot;. It has been successfully playtested on BGII - ToB several times in several iterations, but not
    completed on BGT or BGII:EE. I hope for only a few minor challenges, but it is likely you will run into something odd!<br />
    <br />
    <b>The Mod Concept</b><br />
    NPCs work in many different ways, based primarily on the original BioWare model. What happens, though, if we try a more
    &#39;self aware&#39; NPC, allowing player choice for some of the fundamentals? Is an NPC&#39;s character his class and stats,
    or is it really a personality? Can an NPC still be true to himself, even when a player chooses to turn them into a new class
    combination? This mod explores the idea that jobs may come and go, and in the heart of an accountant may lie a lion, even if
    the body doesn&#39;t quite show it off. The NPC should be able to adapt to being a new class or kit combination, while
    retaining his core personality. As a side project, the intent is to post code in the forum to eventually tie to tutorials and
    provide insight into the decisionmaking process when turning an idea into functional code.<br />
    Aran Whitehand is functionally a Companion mod. He has minor optional quests with a new area, but comes with no special weapons
    or upgradeable items - his specialty is in interacting with the members of the party and adapting to situations. For him, the
    job is paramount, and his job is supporting the player. He is no stranger to having to carry out orders which bend morality,
    though he hates doing so. It should be noted that this mod is designed by adults for adults, and should not be installed unless
    you are comfortable with Faerunian swearing, occasional adult themes, and NC - 17 to R rated content in the Romance
    portion.</p>
  </div>

  <h2><a name="overview" id="overview">Overview</a></h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p><b>The Companion NPC</b><br />
    <b>Aran Whitehand</b> is a human fighter and scribe for BG2, dual classable, so that he can be Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy...
    whatever your party needs. Basically, a human utility player taken along for the friendship/cuddling. &quot;Specials&quot;
    include creation of scrolls through dialog and timer when in a party with another canonical mage. Primarily a male friend who
    can grow into an extended courtship/romance, romanceable by female PCs, Aran has his own sense of humor and specializes in
    bringing others into the conversation.</p>

  </div>

  <h2>Friendship</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Aran will befriend any protagonist of any race or alignment,though how he reacts to situations will definitely let the
    player know how he feels. A rough - around - the - edges man, accustomed to mercenary sevice and caravan work both in front of
    and protecting the books, Aran hires on as a scribe or accountant as well as protection. He has learned to work with
    practically anyone not Drow, and chase any female within arms reach. His language is rough, his approach unrefined. And if you
    don&#39;t like it, he will gladly tell you exactly what your opinion is worth.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Romance</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Aran will romance any female protagonist of any race save Drow, or any alignment. Again, how he reacts will definitely let
    the player understand his position. Good men fall for bad women as quickly as for good ones, and sometimes opposites really do
    attract. But romance on the trail is awkward, with a group of adventurers around, and the road to romance is both rocky and
    complicated. Exactly how does a strong man feel when his significant other turns out to be infinitely stronger than he, on so
    many levels? Can the two of you negotiate the attraction into something of an equal relationship, or is this destined to fail?
    For a sample of lovetalks, please visit the forums.</p>

    <p style="color:red">WARNING. FEMALE PC ROMANCE CAN BE &quot;NOT SAFE FOR WORK&quot;.</p>

    <p>Although your female PC has many opportunities to manage the physical side of the relationship and can always shut him down
    or start him up, if a female player character romances him there is specific, detailed, graphic, poorly written fanfic smut
    that will make for a workplace conversation that you DO NOT want to have. If you have played Romantic Encounters for BG2, Sheri
    and Renal are relatively tame by comparison. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. (If you don&#39;t want it at all, play him with a male PC,
    and all will be completely fine.)</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Joining the Party</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p>When Aran Whitehand meets the party, he is looking for work having dropped from the rolls of a mercenary regiment. Look for
    him in the new inn &quot;The Broken Sword&quot;, found on the Promenade just west of your initial entry into the area from
    Chateau Irenicus.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <p><strong>Aran Whitehand</strong> is designed for use on BGII - SoA, BGII - ToB, BGT, and BGII:EE.</p>
  </div>

  <h2><a name="install" id="install">Installation</a></h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p><br />
    <strong>Windows</strong><br />
    This mod is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is distributed as a
    self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.<br />
    <br />
    Alternatively, the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>. If properly
    extracted, you should have an &quot;aranw&quot; folder and the file &quot;setup-aranw.exe&quot; in your game folder. To
    install, simply double-click setup-aranw.exe and follow the instructions on screen.<br />
    <br />
    Please run setup-aranw in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version.</em> Aran Whitehand is packaged and
    installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod
    into your game folder. If properly extracted, you should have an &quot;aranw&quot; folder, setup-aranw, and setup-aranw.command
    in your game folder. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-aranw.command</strong> and follow the instructions on
    screen.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux
    from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg"><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> and copy WeiDU
    and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your BG2 installation directory, run &#39;tolower&#39; and
    answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you&#39;ve already ran it once in the same
    directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there&#39;s no need to run the first option (lowercasing file
    names) either if you&#39;ve extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you&#39;re unsure,
    running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet. Run <strong>WeInstall aranw</strong> in your game folder to install
    the mod. Then run <strong>wine BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <strong>AranAware</strong><br />
    AranAware can be found [NOT YET AVAILABLE]. It is designed to be run after both Aran Whitehand and other mods, much like
    Crossmod. While many &quot;awareness&quot; comments and dialogs are already enabled passively within the central mod, there are
    cross-mod materials that need adjustment. This add-on should be run after most mods on your install. It only enables
    content/manipulates Aran&#39;s own scripts and files, so should cause no troubles with other mods. Currently, it recognises and
    enables the following content:<br />

  <h2><a name="modder" id="modder">Modder Notes</a></h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p>The philosophy driving coding in this project is to preserve technical operating compatibility with as wide a range of other
    mods as possible. I leave it up to the player to define &#39;conceptual incompatibility&#39; - there are so many mods out there
    now that I think players have the right to choose to add, subtract, or modify within their games without me making those
    decisions up front. Hey, I am a hobbyist, not a professional - if you want professional stuff, go buy it! Some of the things
    done to support this are listed here:</p>

  <h2><a name="funstuff" id="funstuff">Fun Things To Do With Aran</a></h2>

  <div class="section">
    <ul>
      <li>Hang around the Broken Sword for awhile, and you&#39;ll find table chatter. The non-joinable NPCs there have some
      conversations, too. Look for additional content there in later releases.</li>

      <li>Kick him out and take him back in in different ways, in different areas.</li>

      <li>Have a sparring session with him, friend or not, romance or not. All are different, and take advantage of RandomNumber
      generation, so... expect things to be different every playthrough.</li>

      <li>Ask him for advice in different areas.</li>

      <li>Get him drunk. Several times.</li>

      <li>Charm him, and chat...</li>

      <li>Romance: Play an evil female PC and treat him badly... scratch him, bite him, and see what he does.</li>

      <li>Romance: Get into an argument with him, and wen he comes looking to make up, refuse. Or you could try apologising.
      Sometimes he actually accepts.</li>

      <li>Romance: The naughty bits are rather varied and exhaustive. Or at least they try to be. Encourage him, don&#39;t
      encourage him, make him work for it... play however you like.</li>

      <li>Install AranW_Aware after all other NPC mods and Divine Remix, and he will banter with mod added NPCs.</li>

      <li>Play him on BGII:EE. He has content and banters with the BeamHaul crowd, too.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2><a name="thanks" id="thanks">Thanks and Acknowledgements</a></h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p>The current list of folks who have contributed and I wish to thank is on Aran&#39;s forum... or it will be once I have
    gotten that organized</p>

    <p>There is an entire community of folks to thank, for all sorts of reasons, so someone is going to get left out and I am going
    to be very embarrassed. But the folks who really make things fun when working through i.e. stuff, the folks who assisted in
    proofreading, giving critical feedback, and sending those PMs and messages saying &quot;YES!&quot; or &quot;NOOOOO!!!!!!&quot;
    are all part of this mod. The good parts. The bad parts are all mine.</p>

    <p>First off, Domi is a goddess whose work with Dynaheir in BG1NPC originally inspired me to get off of my lazy behind and
    actually become involved in modding. I thank her, curse her, swear at her, and then swear by her, all usually within the same
    20 minutes. Thanks to CamDawg, Grim Squeaker, Smoketest, devSin, Wisp, Taimon, Ascension64, igi, eric, Steve, and Miloch, who
    all show me how things work and manage not to call me an ignorant jackass to my face (mostly). And infinite thanks to Nythrun,
    who showed me patience, great humor, and the power of &quot;just do it.&quot;</p>

    <p>And though he will make an obscene comment or involve Aran in a Dodecahedron mod in retaliation, special thanks to &quot;the
    bigg&quot;. Not just for years of patience and help, but for continuing to support, clean up, extend, and rebuild Weimer&#39;s
    Dialog Utility making it relevant and powerful for today&#39;s modders.</p>

    <p>On this specific project, huge thanks go to Berelinde, who has helped me bounce ideas, clean up/rebuild code, warned me when
    I was getting really gross, poked at me when I slacked, asked the &quot;duh&quot; questions that have set me on new paths,
    reminded me when I have started doing boneheaded things in code, and provided solid criticism. Jastey has been there regularly,
    giving great specific feedback; without these two strong modders as friends, working on and discussing things at Tolkein Across
    The Water, the biggest challenges in the mod would never have been attempted, let alone written. To the Two Mistresses of
    Modding Mayhem, I tip my cap in appreciation, and let you know that you have helped me get hours of enjoyment out of the
    modding challenge. It is great to work with you!</p>

    <p>Special thanks to Peachplums for her donated artwork - check her out at http://peachplums.deviantart.com/ and follow her
    work!</p>

    <p>Lots of people have helped out in this &quot;open code&quot; mod experiment, many with behind-the-scenes PMs that have
    opened new ideas or closed up old ones, others with clear and helpful bug and typo hunting, and still others with the ticklish
    and sensitive &quot;proofread the smut&quot; quotient. My appreciation is fierce. In most cases, my thanks has been to write
    specific pathways or open branches in response to their own particular personal protagonist preference (their &quot;ppp&quot;),
    but some angels have given feedback without indicating what they like in their ppp, so the only coin I have in repayent is
    acknowledgement of contribution. A partial list follows:</p>

    <p>This project has been a blast, even on days when I just wanted to throw it all in and go whack something in Mount &amp;
    Blade or take over the world in Civ III/IV/BTS/V/GK (the project took that long!!). That is entirely due to folks poking at
    Aran with long sticks, asking questions, giving feedback, and making me rethink things.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.jsayles.com/familypages/earlymusic.htm">JSayles Early Music</a> - &quot;All MP3 recordings listed below,
    may be downloaded and distributed free of charge. The recordings may be used for any purpose whatsoever. In fact, that&#39;s
    the only reason I&#39;m doing this to promote Early Music, and especially to promote the musical selections recorded
    below.&quot; - J. Sayles, performer</p>

    <p>Vox Vulgaris - middle ages with a twist. Source - The group. Selections clipped from three of their online materials,
    Cantiga 166, Rokatanc, and Saltarello. Pieces are in public domain, but the performance is copyrighted - probably shorter than
    the &quot;you are stealing this&quot; time index, but if an official someone objects for use in a free mod, I&#39;ll just use
    it on my own install. I have to thank the husband and wife team that developed mount &amp; Blade, because I didn&#39;t know
    there was such great midaevil re-covers from groups like Vox Vulgaris and Hungary Debrecen, until modders put them into their
    M&amp;B mods!</p>

    <p>Brass ensemble, Suzato, The Danseyre. Renaissance, done in a brass arrangement. Czech Brass. Source - Czech Brass album
    &quot;Virtuosi Baroque Music&quot;, on the Sonnleitner Verlag label. Copyrighted, so if someone objects to the rip for a free
    mod, I&#39;ll take it out. But if you find one of their recordings, they are solid brass, more calm in their interpretations
    that the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble or Canadian Brass.</p>
