@10410 = ~Aran Whitehand Rejoins

Aran has rejoined me. With any luck, I will be able to rely on his talents while I face my next challenge.~

// JOURNAL : JOINING leave it in the main journal always. These do NOT need to be added to BGII:EE via ADD_JOURNAL. 

@13146 = ~Aran Whitehand Joins

A sellsword named Aran has joined me. He seems to have had some experience, so perhaps he will be useful. I met him at an inn for mercenaries, The Broken Sword, on the Promenade.~

// JOURNAL : LEAVING (1 of 3 possible entries) Only one of these can be true when he is no longer ever available for rejoining.
// So, to make sure all the journal entries and quests Aran has are not left littering the user's solved/unsolved, 
// remove all of the above entries EXCEPT @13146; remove the other two entries in this batch, and then set the one the dialog expects.
@1705 = ~Whitehand Left for Waterdeep

I sent Aran Whitehand away permanently. He decided to head north to Waterdeep to pursue his own goals. I think that is for the best.~

@1706 = ~Whitehand Sent to the Gods

I destroyed Aran Whitehand. It is good to know that I have the power of life and death at my fingertips, and the will to use that power for my own ends.~

@10405 = ~Whitehand Withdraws

Aran Whitehand deserted the party today. I always suspected that he did not have the strength to follow me. If our paths cross again, it is likely that he will become very sorry that he ever showed his face to me.~



// JOURNAL : RA 2 
@10495 = ~Whitehand Seems Interested in Me

Aran seems to be watching me with more than just friendship in his glances. I will have to decide if this is something I will pursue.~ 

// JOURNAL : RA 2 TURNED 3
@13135 = ~Whitehand Discouraged

Aran seems to have dropped any potential romance with me. I will need to watch him and make sure he understands what I want out of our relationship.~ 
// JOURNAL : RA 3 TURNED 2
@13136 = ~Whitehand Encouraged

I told Aran that we should be more than friends. He seemed to be pleased with the news. I will need to watch him and make sure he understands what I want out of our relationship.~ 

// EXISTING : ROMANCE BODHI ABDUCTION
/* Stage 1 : Set @448 */
@448  = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and stealing Aran from my side. Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi warned that if I continue I will lose even more than I thought possible. I cannot give up on the Rhynn Lanthorn... but now the life and immortal soul of Aran is at stake, as well!~
/* Stage 2 Set @456 */
@456  = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi has turned Aran into a vampire!  Or... or very nearly.  The process may not have been completed in the short time Bodhi has had him.  Hopefully something can be done or I will have lost him.  Perhaps the elven war sage might know some way of restoration... or Elhan...~
/* Stage 3 - Final Set @10399, remove @456 @448 */
@10399 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

While I had feared for some time that Bodhi's final revenge on me would be to take away Aran forever, it seems that the information in the lorebook was right...  Amaunator's idol has restored Aran not only to life, but has removed the vampiric curse from him, as well. And more to the point, it appears his language is quite unaffected.~
